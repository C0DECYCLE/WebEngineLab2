# SpaceEngine

-   [x] dependency injection, import or provider?
-   [ ] clean code robert c martin
-   [x] write tests, fix import extension
-   [x] clean up webgpu, do recap
-   [ ] make small lightweight engine/renderer
-   [ ] make planets (chunk system)
-   [ ] entity graph
-   [ ] astroneer look
-   [ ] cloth simulation
-   [x] scattering system 100% gpu
-   [ ] object container streaming
-   [x] gpu folliage
-   [ ] ghost of tsushima techniques (https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ghost+of+tsushima+gdc)
-   [x] gpu grass
-   [ ] screen space particles
-   [ ] gpu particles
-   [ ] volumetric clouds
-   [ ] screen space shadows (https://panoskarabelas.com/posts/screen_space_shadows/)
-   [ ] astroid cluster, ring, render haze around ring
-   [ ] look at star citizen, ghost of tsushima and space repo for features
-   [ ] webgpu offscreen canvas
-   [ ] worker multi threading
-   [x] compute shader
-   [ ] deferred shading
-   [ ] gpu quadtree, quadtree compute shader
-   [x] grass shading phong & color along blade, curved normals?
-   [x] grass turn around randomly with tilt towards camera
-   [x] grass animate with wind field, random grass scale,
-   [x] grass perlin distribution with clumps, look for other basics then, optimization
-   [ ] gpu floating origin https://godotengine.org/article/emulating-double-precision-gpu-render-large-worlds/
-   [x] drawindircet https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPURenderPassEncoder/drawIndirect
-   [x] gpu frustum culling
-   [ ] gpu timing

//timing, better wind via cull shader not vertex, optimize stuff into computes, better distribution
