//miniature 3d stylized witcher like rpg procedural prototype
//depth of field, advanced lighting (deferred?, global illumination)
//fog, procedural terrain, procedural folliage vegetation grass
//monsters, main character, loot, witcher like
//webgpu, prototype, low poyl? flat smooth or toon shading? normals?
//procedural towns buildings
//inspiration

//frustum cull compute
//just basic flat terrain, color it
//spawn vetegetation
